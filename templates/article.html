                    <section id="intro"><p>William Shakespeare (23 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.
                    </p><p>Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner ("sharer") of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men after the ascension of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and even certain fringe theories as to whether the works attributed to him were written by others.</p>
                    <p>Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in English. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) such as The Winter's Tale and The Tempest, and collaborated with other playwrights.</p><p>Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, who hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: "not of an age, but for all time".</p></section>

                      <h4>Early Life and Background</h4>
                      <hr>
                      <h5>Birth and Family</h5>
                      <p>William Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. He was the son of John Shakespeare, a glove maker and local politician, and Mary Arden, a woman from a prosperous family.</p>
                      <h5>Education and Early Influences</h5>
                      <p>Shakespeare likely attended the King’s New School in Stratford, where he received a classical education, including Latin and literature. However, there is no evidence of him attending university. His exposure to history, poetry, and theatre during his youth played a crucial role in shaping his literary career.</p>
                      <h5>Marriage and Family Life</h5>
                      <p>In 1582, at the age of 18, Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway, who was eight years older than him. They had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Hamnet died at a young age, which some scholars believe influenced Shakespeare’s later tragedies.</p>

                      <p>Between 1585 and 1592, little is known about Shakespeare’s life, a period often called the "Lost Years." Some theories suggest he may have worked as a schoolteacher, traveled across England, or even joined a theatre company.</p>
                      <h5>Arrival in London and Theatrical Beginnings</h5>
                      <p>By 1592, Shakespeare had gained recognition in London’s theatre scene. He began working as an actor, playwright, and shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, a leading theatre company.</p>
                      <h5>The Globe Theatre</h5>
                      <p>In 1599, Shakespeare and his business partners built the Globe Theatre, which became the primary venue for his plays. The open-air theatre attracted audiences from all walks of life, cementing Shakespeare’s influence in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama.</p>
